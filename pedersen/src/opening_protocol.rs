//! Defines an Opening protocol for various PedersenConfig types.
//! That is, this protocol proves knowledge of a value x such that
//! C_0 = g^{x}h^{r} for a Pedersen Commitment C_0 with known generators `g`, `h` and
//! randomness `r`.
//!
//! The proof used here follows the same notation as https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1132.pdf, Appendix A (the "Knowledge of Opening").
//! This is originally due to Schnorr.
