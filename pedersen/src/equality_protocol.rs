//! Defines an Equality protocol for various PedersenConfig types.
//! Specifically, this protocol shows in ZK that C1 and C2 are commitments to the
//! same underlying value (i.e C1 = Comm(x, r1), C2 = Comm(x, r2)).
//! This exact protocol comes from https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1132.pdf, Appendix A (the "Commitment to the same value")
//! which is folklore.
